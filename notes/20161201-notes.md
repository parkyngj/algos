# Notes on upcoming Liftoff Interview

Verbatim from interview email:

  > **Data Structures**

  > One of the most important application design decisions involves which data structure to use. You should know the pros and trade-offs for the most common data structures and when to use what. You should also know the runtime complexities (where applicable) of each. Some examples:

  > * Hash Table
  > * Hash Set
  > * Arrays
  > * Linked Lists
  > * Binary Trees
  > * Graph
  > * Heap

  > **Algorithms**
  * Big-O Notation  
  * Tree and graph traversal algos
  * Sorting algos
  * Search algos

## DIS/ADVANTAGES OF GIVEN DATA STRUCTURES

### Hashes

**Advantages**
* Searches, insertions, deletion are `O(1)` if key is known

**Disadvantages**

* Searches, insertions, deletion are `O(N)` if key is unknown
* In some languages, traversal of elements inside are not possible (only able to search, insert, delete)

### Arrays

#### Unordered

**Advantages**

* Insertion is `O(1)`
* Access to element is `O(1)` if index is known

**Disadvantages**

* Searches, deletion are `O(N)`
* In some languages, arrays are fixed size

#### Ordered

**Advantages**

* Searches are `O(logN)`

**Disadvantages**

* Insertion and deletion are `O(N)`, since we must search for the element, and then move all elements accordingly after insert/delete

### Linked Lists

**Advantages**

* Insertion at the tail is `O(1)`
* Insertion at certain point in the linked list takes at worst `O(n)` to get there, but once we insert, don't need to move elements down. Just change pointers

**Disadvantages**

* Searching is `O(N)`

### Binary Search Trees

**Advantages**

* Searches, insertion, and deletion are all `O(logN)` on average
* Easy to find max and min ()

**Disadvantages**

* Searches, insertion, and deletion are all `O(N)` worst case

### Heaps (Max and Min)

**Advantages**

* Accessing Max/Min is `O(1)` (Since it's just on the top of the heap)
* Supports insertion, deletion in `O(logN)` time.
* Priority Queues are implemented using Binary Heap, used in Dijkstra's algorithm

**Disadvantages**

* Searching possibly worse than binary search tree, since unknown whether to look at left/right subtrees for search element

### Graphs

**Advantages**

* Models real life
* Can be analyzed using adjacency matrix

**Disadvantages**

* Some algorithms involving finding shortest paths and etc. are complicated

## ALGORITHMS

**Tree and Graph Traversal Algos**

* Breadth first traversal (use a queue)
* Depth first traversal (use a stack)
  * For Binary Trees:
    * Pre-order (Root, Left, Right)
    * In-order (Left, Root, Right)
    * Post-order (Left, Right, Root)

**Sorting Algos**

* Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort `O(N^2)`
* Quick Sort, Merge Sort `O(NlogN)`

**Search Algos**

* Binary Search `O(logN)`
* Breadth-first search vs Depth-first search
  * Choose the one that short-circuits the fastest for your problem

## MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

### Difference between a hash table, hash map, and hash set

`HashTable` `HashMap`, and `HashSet` are Java data structures that behave slightly differently. Their primary objective is to retain key/value pairs.

The main difference between `HashTable`/`HashMap` and `HashSet` are that `HashTable` and `HashMap`  allow for duplicate values, while `HashSet` does not allow for duplicate values.

The main difference between `HashTable` and `HashMap` is that `HashTable` does not for null keys and values while `HashMap` does.

#### `HashTable`

* Do not allow `null` for keys nor values
* Does not maintain insertion order
* Synchronized (doesn't let 2 threads access a method/block of code at the same time)
  * The second thread will instead wait until the first is done

#### `HashMap`

* Does allow for null for key and value
* Does not maintain insertion order
  * One of `HashMap`'s subclasses is `LinkedHashMap`, so in the event you'd want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), you could swap out `HashMap` for `LinkedHashMap`
* Not synchronized, so has better performance, but is not thread-safe

#### `HashSet`

* Does not allow for duplicate values
* Not synchronized (so not thread-safe)
