# In graph theory, a connected component (or just component) of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two verties are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph. - Wikipedia

# Given an undirected graph, we print all connected components line by line. For example, consider graph3.gif in this directory.
