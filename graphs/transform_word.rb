# Given a source word, target word and an English dictionary, transform the source word to target by changing/adding/removing 1 character at a time, while all intermediate words being valid English words. Return the transformation chain which has the smallest number of intermediate words.
#
# e.g. If dictionary = ['cat', 'bat', 'bet', 'bed', 'at', 'ad, 'ed']
#
# Then transform_word('cat', 'bed') returns ['cat', 'bat', 'bet', 'bed'].
#
# If dictionary = ['cat, 'bat', 'bed', 'at', 'ad', 'ed']
#
# Then transform_word('cat', 'bed') returns ['cat', 'at', 'ad', 'ed', 'bed'].

# make sure we can assume that both of the words given are actually in the list of words given
# is this case sensitive?
# can we assume that a shortest path actually exists?

# build a graph where the values of the nodes contain the words, and there exists an edge between two nodes if and only if their "edit distance" is 1
# do a breadth first search in the graph starting at word1, look for shortest path to word2
