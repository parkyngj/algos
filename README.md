Record of drills for algorithms/data structures.

## Traversal of Repo

**N.B. that this repository was largely maintained from Nov 2016 to January 2017, and is currently not being updated.**

At the root level, problems are generally separated into the data structures involved in the solution (besides the `dynamic_programming`, `misc`, and `notes` folders.

Feel free also to take a look at [my accountability group's algorithm repo](https://www.github.com/sally/algoccountabilibuddies), which is a bit more organized albeit having less content. (This repo should also be considered inactive, beginning Feb 2017 onward.)
